1) No redistributing of the client files.
It is strictly prohibited to send the files to other users as this could be seen as an attempt to leak it.
This applies to any form of the client, not just the loader DLL file.

2) No malicious links/files.
This includes
- IP grabbers.
- Screamers.
- Links that could potentially grab information about one another.
- Files that could log auth tokens.
- Files that could destroy your operating system.
- Content meant to trigger

3) Reverse engineering is strictly disallowed.
This one is self explanatory, there is a reason we obfuscate our clients to keep exploits unpatched, along with keeping the anticrash at it's peak.

Breaking any of these rules above will result in an instant ban and blacklist from the client, this will simply not be tolerated.
